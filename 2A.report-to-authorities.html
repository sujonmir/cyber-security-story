      <h1>REPORT TO AUTHORITIES</h1>

      <p>
        You contact your country’s cybercrime unit and report the phishing
        attempt. They thank you and ask for the email’s metadata to investigate
        further.
      </p>
      <p>
        You feel proactive—but something nags at you. Was this their only attack
        vector?
      </p>
