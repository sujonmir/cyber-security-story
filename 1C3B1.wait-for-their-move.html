      <h1>The Waiting Game</h1>

      <p>
        You sit back and wait, watching as your decoy identity starts to attract
        attention.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Days pass in silence. Then the first signs appear: small traces of the
          pursuers following your fake trail.
        </li>
        <li>
          But as time goes on, the hunt intensifies. They're getting closer, but
          the real you remains safe—for now.
        </li>
        <li>
          Will they uncover the truth, or will the decoy be enough to buy you
          the time you need to disappear?
        </li>
      </ul>
