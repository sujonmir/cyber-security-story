      <h1>🏃‍♂️ THE PANIC ESCAPE</h1>

      <p>
        You rip the laptop from the wall. <br />
        It sparks. The screen cracks. <br />
        The countdown keeps going.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>GOING LIVE IN: 00:56…</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You bolt out the door barefoot. <br />
        You drive with shaking hands to the nearest police station. <br />

        <strong>Inside: </strong><br />
        You scream your story. <br />
        You show them your shattered laptop. <br />
        They take it to the back. Whisper to each other. <br />

        Then— <br />
        They return with a dead stare.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “There’s nothing on this. No files. No threats. Just... a looping
        video.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        They play it. <br />

        It’s you. <br />
        Sobbing. Naked. Screaming confessions you don’t remember saying. <br />
        In the background: your bedroom, your photos, your life. <br />

        You beg them to believe you. <br />

        They don’t. <br />

        They detain you. <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Charges:</strong> Public deception. Cybercrime fraud.
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In the holding cell, a screen flickers on. <br />
        One final message appears:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="flicking">
        <strong
          >“We stream everything. And no one believes victims anymore.”</strong
        >

        <strong>THE LESSON (Phishing Isn’t Just Email—It’s Fear.)</strong>

        hope that this time, it’s real." <br />
