      <h1>üß† SYSTEM REJECTION</h1>

      <p>
        You don‚Äôt choose. <br />
        You won‚Äôt play their game. <br />

        You pull your Ethernet cable.<br />
        You yank the battery from your laptop.<br />
        You smash the power button.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>Nothing happens.</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Your screen stays on. <br />

        The voice is angry now. No longer distorted‚Äîjust cruel:
      </p>
      <blockquote>‚ÄúYou refuse choice? Then we choose for you.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <p>
        Your screen goes white. <br />

        Your webcam turns.<br />
        <strong>By itself.</strong><br />

        A new window appears:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Break Themselves."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You scream. <br />
        You tear through your room, ripping cords, clawing at the walls. <br />

        You find your keys. <br />
        You drive like your mind is on fire.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        You reach a <strong>bridge</strong>. The one near the old train yard.
        Your phone rings. The voice says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt have to end like this. Just come back. Accept the update.‚Äù
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You look down. <br />
        The water is black. Cold. Empty. <br />
        You step up onto the ledge.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        ‚ÄúYour secrets die with you. But your shadow lives on.‚Äù
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You jump. <br />

        The screen goes black. <br />

        Then white text appears:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        USER_DISCONNECTED. <br />
        Restart? <br />
