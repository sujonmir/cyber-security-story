      <h1>GAME OVER: RESTARTED, BUT NEVER THE SAME</h1>

      <p>
        You try to rebuild your life. You set up new accounts, recover some old
        files from backups, and find a sense of peace... or at least try to. But
        deep down, you know you can never fully escape the consequences of what
        happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hacker is still out there, and the damage is permanent. Every new
        email or social media notification makes you jump, wondering if they’re
        still watching, waiting for the next opportunity.
      </p>
