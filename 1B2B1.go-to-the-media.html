      <h1>GAME OVER: PUBLICITY BLUES</h1>

      <p>
        You take your story to the media, hoping for justice and a platform to
        expose the hacker’s crimes. But it backfires. The media picks up your
        story, but they only focus on the sensational parts: your mistakes, your
        panic, your desperation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Public opinion turns against you. Instead of help, you’re branded as a
        victim who didn’t know how to protect their data.
