      <h1>GAME OVER: THE SECRET BATTLE</h1>

      <p>
        You refuse to give up. You keep fighting back in secret, trying to
        regain control. But the hackers are relentless, and their reach is far
        greater than you realized.
      </p>

      <p>
        Your efforts are futile. They track you down, erase your backups, and
        expose your darkest secrets.
      </p>
