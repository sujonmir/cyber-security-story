      <h1>GAME OVER: WRONG MOVE</h1>

      <p>
        You decide to fight back. You learn a few tricks, gather some tools, and
        start hacking into the hacker’s system. But you’ve underestimated the
        skill of the hacker. What you think is an attack on their system quickly
        turns into a trap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within minutes, they’re in your system again—except this time, it’s much
        worse. Your every keystroke is now tracked. Your camera’s on. You’re
        fully under their control.
      </p>
