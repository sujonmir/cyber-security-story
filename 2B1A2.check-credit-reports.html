      <h1>THE CREDIT CRISIS</h1>

      <p>
        Checking the credit reports reveals a series of fraudulent loans taken
        out in your friend's name. The damage is vast, and it will take months
        of hard work to restore the credit and reverse the fraudulent charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a long road ahead—one that requires patience and legal support.
