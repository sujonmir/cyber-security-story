      <h1>GAME OVER: TRUST NO ONE</h1>

      <p>
        You refuse to follow IT support's instructions. You decide to delete the
        infected files on your own. But in doing so, you miss a critical part of
        the malware that quietly infects the backup drives as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Weeks later, you realize that your system is still compromised, and the
        hacker has full control over your devices.
