      <h1>THE ENCRYPTION TRAP</h1>

      <p>
        You switch to an encrypted email provider, feeling safe. But soon, you
        receive an alarming notification: someone is trying to hack your new
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even encryption isn’t enough to hide your presence in the digital world,
        and now you're caught in an even tighter web of surveillance.
      </p>
