      <p>
        You plug back in. <br />
        <br />
        You whisper to the hacker:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>“Post the real me.”</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The files upload. <br />
        Old diary entries. <br />
        Private therapy session transcripts. <br />
        Everything you never told anyone—not even yourself. <br />
        <br />
        The internet eats it alive. <br />
        Some say you’re brave. <br />
        Most say you’re broken. <br />
        A few say you made it all up for clout. <br />
        <br />
        But the hacker? <br />
        <br />
        They finally go silent. <br />
        <br />
        You’re left with everything exposed. <br />
        And yet… weirdly free. <br />
        <br />
        Your name becomes an urban legend:
      </p>
      <blockquote>"The One Who Confessed to the Cloud."</blockquote>
      <p>
        People start doing it too. <br />
        They call it “Going Full You.” <br />
        <br />
        But your face still auto-fills in search bars… <br />
        Right next to the word <strong>“ruined.”</strong>
      </p>
