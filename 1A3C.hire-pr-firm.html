      <h1>💼 YOU CHOSE: HIRE A PR FIRM</h1>

      <p>
        You wire $15,000 to ImageRevive.co, a crisis management firm with slick
        branding and five-star reviews. <br />
        <br />
        They reply instantly:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong
          >“We’ve handled worse. You’ll be trending neutral in 72
          hours.”</strong
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>They begin crafting your redemption arc:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Statement drafts</li>
        <li>AI-cleansed headshots</li>
        <li>Pre-scheduled apology tour podcasts</li>
        <li>"Behind-the-scenes mental health struggle" narrative</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It works. For a day. <br />
        <br />
        Then the hacker hits them. <br />
        <br />
        DDoS. <br />
        Fake reviews flood their Google profile:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “They defend racists.” <br />
        “This firm helped cover up cybercrime.” <br />
        “Ask them about their own data breach.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Your rep starts tanking again. <br />
        <br />
        Then… your PR agent messages you directly:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “We’re under attack. We have to distance ourselves. You’re on your own.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        They delete your profile from their client list. <br />
        <br />
        And post a vague statement:
      </p>
      <blockquote>“We do not tolerate hate. We have severed ties.”</blockquote>
      <p>You’ve been un-hired.</p>
