      <h1>🫥 NEW IDENTITY.EXE</h1>

      <p>
        You disappear. <br />
        <br />
        New handle. <br />
        New email. <br />
        Deepfake your face, distort your voice. <br />
        You become unrecognizable, even to yourself. <br />
        <br />
        You scrub every trace. <br />
        Delete every cloud backup. <br />
        Even pay for a darknet “identity reboot” service. <br />
        <br />
        But… <br />
        <br />
        Every time you join a new platform, <br />
        someone comments:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>“Hey… don’t you look like—?”</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You never answer. <br />
        You log off. <br />
        You move on. <br />
        <br />
        And one day, you see your old face in an ad.
      </p>
      <blockquote>"The original cancel case."</blockquote>
      <p>
        They’re selling AI-generated drama videos. <br />
        You’re the villain. <br />
        <br />
        You scream at the screen— <br />
        but no one knows your voice anymore.
