      <h1>TURN ON 2FA</h1>

      <p>
        You enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA), adding an extra layer of
        security to your account. Even if someone guesses your password, they
        still need your phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        You feel more secure already. It's a small change, but it makes a big
        difference.
