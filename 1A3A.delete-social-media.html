      <h1>🧹 YOU CHOSE: DELETE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA</h1>

      <p>
        Click. <br />
        Delete account. <br />
        Deactivate. <br />
        Scrub. <br />
        Scrub. <br />
        Scrub. <br />
        <br />
        But it’s too late. <br />
        <br />
        Screenshots live forever. <br />
        Your high school enemy reposts them with commentary: <br />
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>
          “Always knew they were trash.” <br />
          A bot account turns your face into a meme. <br />
          Someone finds your old yearbook photo and overlays the slurs.
        </strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You're trending. <br />
        <br />
        Not for who you are, <br />
        but for what they made you seem to be. <br />
        <br />
        You get doxxed. <br />
        Your family gets threats. <br />
        The pizza place refuses your order— <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>“We don’t deliver hate.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        You unplug. <br />
        <br />
        You sit in silence. <br />
        <br />
        Then the lights flicker. <br />
        Your smart speaker whispers:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Don’t worry. We kept a copy of the real you.” <br />
        “Want us to post it?”
      </blockquote>
