      <h1>THE DAMAGE REPORT</h1>

      <p>
        You notify every financial institution your friend has ever dealt with.
        Some respond quickly, others not so much. But at least the breach is now
        logged across the board.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some accounts are shut down. Others are flagged. And in time, recovery
        becomes possibleâ€”even if not total.
      </p>
