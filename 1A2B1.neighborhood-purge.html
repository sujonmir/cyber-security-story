      <h1>ðŸª“ NEIGHBORHOOD PURGE</h1>

      <p>
        You grab the axe. <br />

        Your neighborâ€™s smart home glows like a circuit boardâ€”every bulb, every
        camera blinking in rhythm. <br />

        You kick the door down. <br />
        They scream. <br />
        You swing. <br />
        First the Alexa hub, then the thermostat, then the refrigerator that
        probably knows your Spotify login.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>
          "He's lost it!" <br />
          "CALL THE COPS!" <br />
          "Waitâ€”he's not wrong. Mine's talking tooâ€”"
        </strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Chaos spreads. <br />

        You start a movement. <br />

        By nightfall, the block is in flames. <br />

        By morning, you're a meme:
      </p>
      <blockquote>"The Firewall Prophet."</blockquote>
      <p>
        They call you a hero. <br />

        Until someone uploads a video of you mid-rampage.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Your face. <br />
        Glitched. Filtered. Labeled: "Domestic Terrorist."
      </blockquote>
      <p>By sunset, your name is on every screen.</p>
