      <p>
        Enough. <br />
        <br />
        You pull out your old drives. <br />
        The emails. <br />
        The receipts. <br />
        The voice memos. <br />
        The screenshots. <br />
        <br />
        You drop them all online. <br />
        Anonymous tip threads. <br />
        Leaked group chats. <br />
        Exposed DMs. <br />
        <br />
        You don’t care anymore. <br />
        <br />
        Influencers. <br />
        Exes. <br />
        Your own coworkers. <br />
        <br />
        No one is safe. <br />
        <br />
        You're no longer the target. <br />
        You’ve become the chaos. <br />
        <br />
        The world burns with you. <br />
        <br />
        And as the headlines swirl…
      </p>

      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You vanish into the static. <br />
        <br />
        And in the silence, <br />
        a message pings your screen:
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Well played. Welcome to the network.”</blockquote>
