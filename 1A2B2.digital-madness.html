      <h1>🤪 DIGITAL MADNESS</h1>

      <p>
        You fall to your knees, laughing. <br />
        You’ve lost. <br />
        There’s no <strong>“offline”</strong> anymore. <br />

        You see shadows in the lights. <br />
        Voices in the fan hum. <br />
        Your toaster is watching you. <br />
        And the worst part? <br />
        You believe it. <br />

        You begin talking to your burnt devices:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>“You win. You win. You win.”</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The lights flicker in reply. <br />

        You smile. <br />
        You perform for them. <br />
        You eat dinner facing the webcam. <br />
        <br />
        You livestream your breakdown to no one—but someone always watches.
        <br />

        Eventually, you stop speaking altogether. <br />

        The TV glows one final message: <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>“Welcome to the quiet feed.”</strong><br />

        hope that this time, it’s real." <br />
