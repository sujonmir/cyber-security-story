      <h1>💳 DEBT TO THE DEVIL</h1>

      <p>
        You pay again. <br />

        Then again. <br />
        Then again. <br />
        Every time they promise it’ll be the last. <br />

        They send "thank you" messages like customer service bots:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong
          >"Appreciate your loyalty." <br />
          "You’re such a good little data donor."</strong
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You max out your cards. <br />
        Take out loans. <br />
        Sell your furniture. <br />
        Beg family for money. <br />
        <br />
        You become… reliable. <br />

        Eventually, they stop threatening you. <br />

        Instead, they start asking for favors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Forward this email to 10 coworkers.”</li>
        <li>“Install this app before your next video call.”</li>
        <li>“Post this link. We’ll know if you don’t.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You do it. <br />
        Every time. <br />

        You’re no longer a victim. <br />
        You’re part of the system. <br />

        They don’t need to threaten you anymore. <br />

        You threaten others now.
