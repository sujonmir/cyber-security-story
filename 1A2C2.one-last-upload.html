      <h1>üñ•Ô∏è ONE LAST UPLOAD</h1>

      <p>
        No. <br />
        You won't pay again. <br />

        You go to your closet. <br />
        Pull out an old backup drive‚Äîcold, dusty, analog. <br />

        You boot up your dusty 2005 laptop. <br />
        No Wi-Fi. <br />
        No Bluetooth. <br />
        No mic. <br />

        Just code. <br />

        You upload a virus you wrote back in high school. <br />
        Simple. Crude. <br />
        But it's hungry. <br />

        You connect it to your router for one last shot. <br />

        The lights flicker. <br />
        The room heats up. <br />
        Fans spin like jet engines. <br />

        Then‚Äîeverything goes dark. <br />

        No fan noise. <br />
        No buzz. <br />
        No ping. <br />

        You fried everything‚Äîyourself included. <br />

        Your screens stay black. <br />
        Forever. <br />

        The internet forgets you. <br />
        No traces. <br />
        No backups. <br />
        No ransom note. <br />

        <strong>You win.</strong> <br />
        But you vanish. <br />
      </p>
