      <h1>FIGHT BACK IN SECRET</h1>

      <p>
        You refuse to accept defeat. You begin working in the shadows, using
        your knowledge to sabotage their operations. You fight back, slowly
        regaining bits of control. You create decoy accounts and hide your
        traces.
      </p>

      <p>
        But every time you feel like you’re winning, the hackers strike back.
        They tighten their grip, leaving you in a constant state of fear and
        paranoia. Eventually, the stress becomes too much, and your efforts are
        thwarted.
