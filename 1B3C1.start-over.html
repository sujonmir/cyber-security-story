      <h1>GAME OVER: STARTING OVER</h1>

      <p>
        You decide to wipe everything clean and start anew. You erase all your
        files, abandon your old identity, and begin rebuilding your life from
        scratch.
      </p>

      <p>
        But no matter how hard you try, the past follows you. The hackers'
        digital fingerprints are everywhere, and you can never fully escape
        their grasp.
      </p>
