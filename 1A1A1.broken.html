      <h1>💸 DEBT OF THE SOUL</h1>

      <p>
        You type: <br />
        <strong>"$0. I'm broken."</strong> <br />
        The teller smiles—no mouth, just teeth where eyes should be.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>Honesty. How quaint.</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The vault door behind you creaks open. Inside: a single chair, facing a
        monitor. <br />
        You sit. <br />
        It auto-plays a livestream. <br />
        <strong>Your life. Every moment. Replayed.</strong> <br />
        Your mistakes. Your searches. Your secrets. <br />
        Every laugh, every scream, every cry. <br />
        The chat scrolls fast:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “lol what a loser” <br />
        “they paid and STILL lost” <br />
        “who does that with peanut butter??”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You cover your eyes. <br />
        It doesn't help. <br />
        They've made your pain... a show.
      </p>
      <blockquote>YOU ARE NOW PROPERTY OF: LAUGHNET V5.1</blockquote>
      <p>
        You’re not bankrupt. <br />
        You’re forever content.
