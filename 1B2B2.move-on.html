      <h1>GAME OVER: THE EMPTY ROAD AHEAD</h1>

      <p>
        You walk away, accepting that there’s nothing the authorities can do.
        You try to move on, but the sense of helplessness lingers. Your data is
        lost forever, and the hacker is still out there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each time you check your email or scroll through your social media, you
        wonder: Did they already get to my friends and family? Will they ever
        stop?
      </p>
