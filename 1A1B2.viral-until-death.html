      <h1>📺 VIRAL UNTIL DEATH</h1>

      <p>
        You don’t move. <br />
        <br />
        You just sit. <br />
        Let the stream begin.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>GOING LIVE IN: 00:00</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Your screen flashes. <br />

        You’re now the star of a live feed watched by tens of thousands. <br />
        Your face is filtered, warped—made monstrous. <br />
        Everything you do is reinterpreted by their AI. <br />
        A cry becomes laughter. <br />
        A blink becomes a threat. <br />
        A silence becomes a confession. <br />

        The stream title updates: <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>“REAL-LIFE CYBER FREAKOUT 🔴 24/7”</blockquote>
      <p>
        You beg them to stop. <br />
        The comments flood in:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “This guy’s better than Netflix.” <br />
        “When does he cry again?” <br />
        “I bet he breaks in 3… 2…”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You try to end it. <br />
        But they’ve disabled your rights. Your keyboard. Your name. <br />

        Your soul is now <strong>open source</strong>.
