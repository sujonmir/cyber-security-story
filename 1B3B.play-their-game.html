      <h1>PLAY THEIR GAME</h1>

      <p>
        You decide to pretend to comply with their demands while secretly trying
        to outsmart them.
      </p>

      <p>
        They begin to push harder, testing your limits. But you stay calm, using
        your knowledge of cybersecurity to stall them. You create fake files,
        mislead them, and hack back at small levels, trying to throw them off
        your trail.
      </p>
