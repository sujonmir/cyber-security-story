      <h1>A New Beginning</h1>

      <p>
        You start over from scratch. You’ve erased all traces of your past, and
        now, you walk into a world without connections or history.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No social media. No digital records. No one knows your name.</li>
        <li>
          But as you settle into your new life, you feel the weight of
          isolation. You’re a ghost.
        </li>
        <li>
          With no past to tether you, you wonder: is freedom worth the
          loneliness?
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"You’re free… but at what cost?"</strong>
      </blockquote>

        price."
