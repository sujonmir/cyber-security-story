      <h1>CALL IT SUPPORT - FINAL ATTEMPT</h1>

      <p>
        The IT support guy is still on the line. His voice is more sympathetic
        now. "I’m afraid your situation is worse than we thought. You’ll have to
        wipe everything. I can help guide you through it."
      </p>

      <p>But you hesitate. Something doesn’t feel right.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong
          >"Are you sure you want to do this? It's your last chance to save any
          data."
        </strong>
      </blockquote>
