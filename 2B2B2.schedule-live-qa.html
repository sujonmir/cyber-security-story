      <h1>The Cyber Q&A</h1>

      <p>
        You host a live session with a cybersecurity expert. People from your
        network join, eager to learn.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>They ask about email scams, password safety, and more.</li>
        <li>The expert shares tips that stun even longtime tech users.</li>
        <li>You record it—and it becomes a mini-series for awareness.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"Give people access to truth, and they’ll use it."</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        What started as a simple effort to warn your circle becomes an
        educational series shared across your community.
