        You pay the $50, crossing your fingers, hoping that this will undo the
        damage. The tool starts to run. The countdown ticks away.
      </p>
      <p>But then, the screen freezes. Another pop-up appears:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"ERROR: SYSTEM IS LOCKED. YOU’RE TOO LATE." </strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>The screen glitches. You hear your own voice on the speakers:</p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"YOU’VE BEEN PLAYED." </strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The hacker’s voice echoes through your room. You realize—too late—that
        it was all a trap. The tool was just another part of the scam. Your
        money is gone. Your files are still locked.
