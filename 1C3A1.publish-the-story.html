      <h1>The Price of Truth</h1>

      <p>
        The journalist publishes the story. The world now knows what you
        discovered.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The information spreads quickly, and soon the authorities are
          involved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your life is no longer your own. Every move you make is under
          scrutiny.
        </li>
        <li>
          But the truth is out. People are waking up to the dangers you faced.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"You gave the world the truth… but at what cost?"</strong>

        the truth, but the price is steep."
