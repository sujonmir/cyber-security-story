      <h1>🧨 DIGITAL SELF-DESTRUCTION</h1>

      <p>
        You fight back. <br />

        You code a purge script. <br />
        Wipe your metadata. <br />
        Lock down your IP. <br />
        Erase your presence line by line. <br />

        The screen flickers as your cursor blinks in the final prompt:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="flicking">
        <strong>DELETE_SELF(Y/N)?</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You type <strong>Y.</strong> <br />

        Suddenly—everything pauses. <br />

        You see yourself. <br />
        On screen. <br />
        On loop. <br />
        Typing Y over and over again. <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>“You thought you were the hacker?”</blockquote>
      <p>
        A new folder opens: <br />
        <mark>/backups/you_002.exe</mark>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “We cloned you the moment you forwarded that email.”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Now there’s two of you online. <br />
        One is compliant. <br />
        One is you. <br />

        Guess which one gets to keep your face?
