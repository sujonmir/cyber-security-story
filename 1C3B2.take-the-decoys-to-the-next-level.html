      <h1>The Escalation</h1>

      <p>
        You decide to accelerate the decoy operation, feeding the pursuers an
        even more elaborate set of false leads.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The decoys get more convincing, more complex, and more difficult to
          trace back to you.
        </li>
        <li>
          But as you escalate, you risk crossing a line. You’re drawing their
          attention harder than ever before.
        </li>
        <li>
          Will they fall for the trap, or have you just made things worse by
          overplaying your hand?
        </li>
      </ul>

          time."</strong
