      <h1>📢 YOU CHOSE: PUBLICLY APOLOGIZE</h1>

      <p>
        You go live. <br />
        <br />
        Eyes puffy. <br />
        Voice cracking. <br />
        You say everything right:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong
          >"My accounts were hacked." <br />
          "This does not represent who I am." <br />
          "I am deeply sorry to anyone hurt."</strong
        >
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Then you pause. <br />
        <br />
        You wait. <br />
        <br />
        But the internet doesn't. <br />
        <br />
        Comments flood in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>“Sure, blame the ‘hackers.’”</li>
        <li>“If that’s not who you are, why were those words even typed?”</li>
        <li>“Cancel them harder.”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>#isthisyou</strong> trends. <br />
        <br />
        People pull old jokes, taken out of context. <br />
        Someone finds your college blog. <br />
        A podcast you forgot about. <br />
        That one meme you reshared in 2014. <br />
        <br />
        Suddenly, your apology is its own scandal. <br />
        <br />
        Then your boss calls:
      </p>
      <blockquote>"We’re letting you go. Can’t risk the PR."</blockquote>
      <p>
        And the hacker? <br />
        <br />
        They post one last thing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Apology accepted... by no one.”</blockquote>
