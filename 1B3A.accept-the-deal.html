      <h1>ACCEPT THE DEAL</h1>

      <p>
        You’ve made your decision. You send the hackers the requested access and
        give up all digital control.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, nothing seems to happen. You feel a brief sense of relief…
        until you realize that you’ve given them access to everything. Your
        passwords, emails, files, and even your webcam are under their control
        now.
      </p>
