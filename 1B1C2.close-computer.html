      <h1>THE LAST ESCAPE</h1>

      <p>
        In a panic, you shut down your computer. The screen goes black, and for
        a moment, you think you’ve escaped.
      </p>
      <p>But then, your phone buzzes. You unlock it.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"Your system has been compromised." </strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        The message is from an unknown number. It’s followed by a link to your
        files— still encrypted, still locked.
      </p>

      <p>
        You feel the walls closing in. The hacker isn’t just in your
        computer—they’ve infiltrated your phone, your life. Everything is
        connected, and there’s no easy way out.
      </p>

      <p><strong>You can’t escape the digital trap. It’s too late.</strong></p>

        <strong>THE LESSON (You Can’t Outrun Your Mistakes.)</strong><br />
        "Once you’ve been hacked, there’s no shutting it down completely. The
        best defense is prevention. Secure your devices before it's too late."
