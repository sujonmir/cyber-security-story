      <h1>⚫ FINAL BLACKOUT</h1>

      <p>
        You snap. <br />

        You grab the hammer again. <br />

        TV—smashed. <br />
        Smart speaker—crushed. <br />
        Microwave—just in case. <br />

        You rip your phone in half with your bare hands. <br />
        Your home becomes a digital graveyard. <br />

        Finally, silence. <br />
        No blinking lights. <br />
        No cameras. <br />
        Just you. <br />

        You sit in the dark. <br />

        Then you hear a knock at the door. <br />

        You check the peephole. <br />
        No one’s there. <br />

        But on the doormat: <br />
        A box. <br />
        <strong>Inside:</strong> <br />
        A brand new router. <br />
        Already plugged in. <br />

        Your lights turn back on.
      </p>
