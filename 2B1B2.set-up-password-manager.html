      <h1>THE VAULT OF SECURITY</h1>

      <p>
        You set up a password manager to store and manage your friend's
        passwords securely. It’s a tool designed to reduce the risks of password
        reuse and make it easier to keep track of complex login credentials.
      </p>
      <p>
        But even with the password manager in place, you know that maintaining
        good habits and continuous vigilance is essential.

        good as the habits behind it."
