      <h1>THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE</h1>

      <p>
        You enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for all your friend's
        accounts, adding an extra layer of security. It's a wise step, but it
        won't make the world safer on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time passes, it becomes clear that no system is completely foolproof.
        But with 2FA in place, you're confident your friend is better protected.
      </p>
