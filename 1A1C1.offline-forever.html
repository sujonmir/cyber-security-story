      <p>
        You smash your phone. <br />
        Crack. Sparks. Silence. <br />
        Then you pull the routerâ€™s plug. <br />
        Your whole apartment goes dark. <br />

        You sit in the silence, breathing heavy. <br />
        The buzzing in your head slowly fades. <br />

        For a momentâ€¦ peace. <br />

        You run. <br />

        You flee the city. <br />

        You ditch your devices. <br />
        Go analog. Cash only. Candlelight. Woods. <br />

        Years pass. <br />

        One day you hear a whisper in the trees:
