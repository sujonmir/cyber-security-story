      <h1>USE ANONYMITY TOOLS</h1>

      <p>
        You follow the hacker's instructions and use the tools to completely
        erase your digital identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your presence online disappears. No trace. No history. No past. But it
        feels like you're losing yourself in the process.

        might save you from others, but it also means you're lost to yourself."
