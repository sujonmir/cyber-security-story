      <h1>SET UP RECOVERY QUESTIONS</h1>

      <p>
        You set up recovery questions for all your accounts, ensuring you have a
        backup method to regain access in case you lose your phone or forget
        your passwords.
      </p>
      <p>
        These questions can be a lifesaver, but you also make sure they're hard
        to guess.
      </p>
