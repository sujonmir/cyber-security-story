      <h1>🔥 TARGET LOCKED</h1>

      <p>
        You stare at the grid of faces. <br />
        Every one of them… someone you’ve laughed with, cried with, lived with.
        <br />
        The cursor blinks. Your heartbeat syncs with it. <br />
        <strong class="flicking">You choose</strong>.<br />
        Their face enlarges.<br />
        The others vanish.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>“Good. Loyalty is currency. We paid in theirs.”</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Your webcam light turns red again. <br />
        The screen shows your chosen person, captured through another lens.<br />
        They're sitting at home. A normal day. Until…
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Watch closely.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        The footage glitches. <br />
        Their screen lights up.<br />
        <strong
          >The hacker is contacting them. With your secrets. Your face. Your
          voice.</strong
        ><br />

        You scream.<br />
        You slam your laptop shut.<br />
        You grab your phone.<br />
        You run.<br />
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        You burst into the nearest police station, breathless, shaking, a
        digital corpse of a person.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “They’re watching me! They’ve ruined me! It’s not me—it’s them!”
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        You show them your laptop. <br />
        You play the file.<br />
        You scroll through the emails, the faces, the horror.<br />

        But the files are gone.<br />
        All of them.<br />
        Replaced with cheerful music and kitten gifs.<br />
        The officer looks at you, blank.<br />
      </p>
      <p><strong>“Have you taken anything… today?”</strong></p>
      <p>
        Your phone vibrates in your pocket. <br />
        One notification:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>“SACRIFICE ACCEPTED. YOU ARE FREE.”</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        But you’re not. <br />
        You never will be.
