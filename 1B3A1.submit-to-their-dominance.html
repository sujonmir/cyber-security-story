      <h1>SUBMIT TO THEIR DOMINANCE</h1>

      <p>
        You’ve made your choice. You’ve handed over everything. Now, the hackers
        control every part of your digital existence. Your life is no longer
        your own. Every action you take is under their watchful eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        They send commands. You obey. Your freedom is gone, and you can’t stop
        them. They monitor everything you do, manipulating your every move,
        ensuring you never break free.
      </p>
