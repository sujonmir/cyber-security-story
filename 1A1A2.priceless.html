      <h1>💎 FRAUD DETECTED</h1>

      <p>
        You type: <br />
        <strong>"Priceless."</strong> <br />
        The teller tilts its head.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>“Incorrect.”</strong>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Alarms blare. Red lights flash. <br />
        You’re thrown into a virtual courtroom. <br />
        The jury? <br />
        Your ex. <br />
        Your boss. <br />
        Your mom. <br />
        That teacher you cheated on the quiz in 7th grade. <br />
        All watching.
      </p>
      <blockquote>This user attempted to impersonate value.</blockquote>
      <p>
        You try to speak. But your mouth is coded shut. <br />
        The judge, a corrupted version of you, bangs the gavel.
      </p>

      <p>
        You scream inside. <br />
        Your face warps. <br />
        Your bio updates in real-time:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        🌟 Always smiling! Positivity is my brand! 💖 <br />
        New upload every day or I get punished! 😊
      </blockquote>
      <p>Your mind fades. But the smile stays.</p>
