      <h1>The Screenshot Shield</h1>

      <p>
        You craft a post showing exactly what the fake support messages look
        like.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>People recognize it instantly and share your post.</li>
        <li>Victims thank you for helping them realize it was a scam.</li>
        <li>
          Several community groups pin your warning to the top of their feeds.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>"Sometimes a screenshot is stronger than a firewall."</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You didn’t just raise awareness—you built a digital shield for others to
        stand behind.
