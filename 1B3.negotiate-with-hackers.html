      <h1>NEGOTIATE WITH THE HACKERS</h1>

      <p>
        You decide to try and negotiate with the hackers. You send a message,
        offering them a higher ransom, hoping they’ll release your data.
      </p>

      <p>They respond quickly, but their message is not what you expected:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <strong>"WE DON’T NEED YOUR MONEY. WE WANT CONTROL."</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        It becomes clear: they’re not after cash. They want something more—your
        complete compliance.
      </p>

      <h3>Your options:</h3>
