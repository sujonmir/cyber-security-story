      <h1>THE BACKDOOR EXPLOSION</h1>

      <p>
        You test your accounts for backdoors, only to discover multiple hidden
        access points left behind by previous breaches. You’re not in control of
        your own accounts anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        With each test, you realize just how much of your digital life has been
        compromised—and now the hackers can access your accounts at will.
      </p>
