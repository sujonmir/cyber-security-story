      <h1>💸 YOU CHOSE: Surrender and Pay Again</h1>

      <p>
        You exhale. <br />
        Trembling, you open the payment portal again. <br />
        Your credit card shakes in your hand. <br />
        You type the numbers. <br />
        Click “Send.” <br />
        <br />
        A message appears.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <strong>“Nice doing business. For now.”</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Your devices go quiet. <br />
        Your inbox clears. <br />
        Your webcam light turns off. <br />

        For a moment, it feels like it worked. <br />

        You take a shower. <br />
        You sit in silence. <br />
        You even smile. <br />

        Then— <br />

        Your screen flickers back on. <br />

        A new demand: <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Double the payment. 6 hours to comply.”</blockquote>
      <p>
        You scroll down. <br />

        <strong>Attached:</strong> <br />
        Every file you ever thought was private. <br />
        Photos. Bank info. Voice memos. Journal entries. <br />
        Even drafts you never saved. <br />
      </p>
      <blockquote>“Double the payment. 6 hours to comply.”</blockquote>
